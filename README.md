Application name: Death App  
Date updated: March 2024 
Developer: Lungelo Ngcemu

**Purpose**
The Death App is a mobile application that deals with a serious topic yet does its best to make a light situation of it. Death has always been a factor in human existence and will continue to be, as long as there is human life, death will continue to show its horns in a world of peace and also in a world of war.

The application is a way to help lighten the death factor in this world; it seeks to make light of all the pain we have felt in losing our greatest in human history. Whenever a user plays the application, it makes the user open their eyes to the ages that other people died at, especially their own age. Users often do not know certain historical figures, and a name is not enough to know who that individual really is, which brings us to the Death application that not only shows words or names but also provides a visual illustration of that historical figure and a quote to better understand the historical figure's way of thinking.

**Design**
The Death application follows a material UI design as it is the standard for web and mobile applications. The dark colours also mixed with a bit of light are to convey the sad point of death. The Death application uses a card widget/layout to display the name, age, and quote of the deceased individual. The card keeps a light white background to help emphasize the words displayed in it, giving it more attention for the user to be able to focus on what is most important (the information provided). The Joker is the background image as it adds a sense of creepiness to it with the title being Death. The image in the card changes every time a user enters something, adding to the excitement of playing the game of death. Whenever an invalid input is made, the display changes, encouraging the user to never make the same mistake again.
The layout of the application is kept as simple as possible, making sure there is nothing that looks cluttered along with a font that is visibly seen as clear as possible, the buttons also being of material design as it is a native application that has been developed.

**Utilization of GitHub**
 GitHub has been utilized to store the source code online and also to track any changes that will be made to the application. The use of GitHub allows easy access to the application, allowing for other contributors to implement their ideas thus improving the application to be better.
Utilization of GitHub Action
GitHub Actions is used to analyse, security scans, and other verifications to ensure code quality and security compliance. GitHub action helps to quality check the code to make sure it will produce a robust application able to operate on most mobile devices. The Death app has utilized it to make sure that when the death application is run it will be fit for production.

**Future Development**
 In the future development of the Death application, I will add API integration to fetch the historical figures along with their quotes and images. Using an API will be very beneficial as there won't be a limit locally on the amount of historical figures, even though the disadvantage will be that the application can only work when it's hooked up to the internet. One alternative option is to store the list on an online database such as Firebase, Appwrite, or Supabase then fetch each item by id reference.
The Death application is not in need of a clear button as it would be a benefit to add a timer for the User to read then automatically clear the screen as soon as the timer has reached its time limit. Another alternative to the clear button would be to automatically clear as soon as something new is typed in. The main problem with this is inputting values and not being able to control when you actually want to clear everything. Video clips of the historical figure would play a big role in being able to educate the user on the life of the historical figures. Images are very good but they lack the detail of a motion picture that's able to capture the essence of a story; being able to tell their story with videos allows the user to not be too worried about reading the screen but just simply taking in the information. The User can also share their input or comments on the life story of the historical figure that dies and tell the others of the kind of things that the figure could have done better and the things that they did perfectly.

**Challenges**
 One of the challenges of developing the Death application was the structure of the Map that is used in Kotlin. Maps in Kotlin are different from all the maps in other programming languages; it could be due to that Kotlin comes from Java or that it completely has its own unique way of creating Maps. Kotlin is weird in that it separates its file for layout and the coder has to make the code relate via @id. The XML structure for creating a row and a column is a bit weird also as they have inputs of horizontal and vertical. Kotlin might be simple in that it doesn't have much complexity to it but a big disadvantage should I want to make the application compatible for iOS. Even though native application building is said to produce a faster application but in reality, whoever even notices those microseconds delays in speed.
Highlights
 The most enjoyable thing about developing the Death application was creating an interface that will be able to visually show all the historical figures, using colours to make the interface exciting. Nesting the for if statements was interesting in that choosing the highest if statement to be the most important one. The logic of programming the logic to follow the right sequence proved to be a great exercise.
 
**Research**
 The historical figures that are in the application have been researched and the references for the sources will be provided at the end of this document. The most tricky historical figure to write on was Chris Hani. Chris Hani was an African National Congress leader who believed that South Africa can only be when all the black people in South Africa are treated as equals in all things. It is often said that he was killed by the ANC as he was unwilling to accept the change that Mandela was negotiating for. He was ready to go to war for the liberation of the Native black Africans, but his goals no longer aligned with the vision that the African National Congress was implementing through Nelson Mandela. Mandela's Ideal for liberation was welcomed freely but later in the years to come, the youth of South African no longer aligned fully with his ideals as he was seen as a sellout to the cause of the liberation of the Native black Africans(O’Malley Archives, 1993).

**Historical Figures**
The Death application contains a list of eleven historical figures that are world know even though some are more famous than others.
